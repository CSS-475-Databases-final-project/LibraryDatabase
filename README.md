# LibraryDatabase
A library database created for CSS 475: Database Systems final project. It is for a library system encompassing multiple libraries. It contains an inventory of books. It tracks customers and their books on loan, the books in stock, how many of them are in stock, and where theyâ€™re found. It also tracks author information like the books they authored. The data itself is generated from AI, for all attributes of all tables. Similar to KCLS or Sno-Isle, this library system also contains several branches at different locations in the same metro area.
